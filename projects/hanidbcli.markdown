_hAnidbCli_ is a work in progress library in haskell for interfacing with the
[aniDB](http://anidb.net) UDP API.

Basically its a nicer haskell wrapper around the UDP API in a manner that makes
interacting with the API much much nicer. The aniDB is basically a database of
animation that has been produced, and it provides quite a few nice
functionality via its API. This project is no where near production ready, its
unfortunately still missing out on quite a few critical features. This will
eventually get rectified, and I'm hoping to make an actual release of the
library along with an application that uses it.
