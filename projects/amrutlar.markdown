_Amrutlar.com_ is the configuration and source for the site generator that
generates this site. The original unprocessed markdown content is available
also. This is mainly here so that folks who are interested in how this site
is generated can inspect the source/configuration.

The site is being generated by [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) which is a
static site generator in [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org). It also uses
[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for generating the CSS for this site.

The licensing of this project is tad complicated. I reserve all copyright to my
own self created content such as the articles, project list, about, resume and
so forth. However the source code for the Hakyll and SASS part of the site is
licensed under AGPL v3.
