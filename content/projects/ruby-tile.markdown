_Ruby Tile engine_ is a project in which I did some work on making a barebone
little tiling engine in Ruby.

There isn't much to be said about this project, other than that I implemented a
very basic tiling engine in Ruby and then translated some little engine demo
from Perl into Ruby.  Finally I also experimented with subdivision of a sphere
in Ruby then C.
