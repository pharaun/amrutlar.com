		<h1>What's this all about?</h1>

		<p>I created this site in early 2009 so that I could have a
		central location for all of my thoughts, photographs, and
		various projects that I've worked on over the years. This site
		is mainly focused on the various projects that I'm working on,
		mostly related to 
		<a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, 
		<a href="http://gallery.amrutlar.com">Photography</a>, or
		various other topics.</p>

		<h1>Who I am</h1>

		<p>I'm Anja Berens.  I was born in 1985 and grew up in 
		<a href="http://strattoncolorado.com/">Stratton</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.colorado.com/">Colorado</a>, a sleepy
		little town along Interstate 70 in eastern Colorado.
		There I attended the 
		<a href="http://www.strattonschools.org/">Stratton School District</a>,
		where I graduated in 2003. Shortly thereafter I moved a-cross
		the country to attend 
		<a href="http://www.rit.edu/">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>. There
		I majored in Software Engineering with a focus/concentration
		on; Architecture of the CPU, and the Network &amp; the
		Internet.  I graduated with a B.Sc. in Software Engineering from
		<a href="http://www.rit.edu/">RIT</a> in May 2009 and am considering returning
		for graduate studies in Computer Science.</p>

		<h1>Where I am</h1>

		<p>I am currently living in 
		<a href="http://www.townofchelmsford.us/">Chelmsford</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.mass.gov/">Massachusetts</a> 
		where I am working at
		<a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> 
		as a Software Engineer for their
		<a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/">Lotus</a> 
		division in the Greater
		<a href="http://www.boston.com/">Boston</a> 
		area.</p>

		<h1>What are my interests?</h1>

		<p>I have varying interests, but the majority of my interest/projects tends to
		be computer-related such as
		<a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>.  I used to have no hobby programming
		projects unill a friend of mine kicked me in the rear and made me learn
		<a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> for a couple of System Administrator
		related tasks.  From that point on I realized that programming projects
		did't need to be heavy weight and I rapidly began several projects, mainly in
		<a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> then later in
		<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>.  After that my interests 
		spread to additional topics such as
		<a href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a>, and various other projects.</p>

		<p>I also have a life long interest in photography. I was the
		young child who would sneak into his parent's closet to play
		around with the 35-mm Film SLR camera that was being stored
		there.  Through a course in high school I learned all about
		film photography and the post-processing steps that had to take
		place after you snapped a shot.  In college I was able to
		finally acquire my first camera, a Canon PowerShoot A620.  I
		began investing a lot of my time and energy into taking
		photographs of things that inspired me, with a focus in
		landscape and macro photography.  Later on I was starting to
		feel limited by the inability to swap the lens and its weaker
		handling of night-time shoots and finally upgraded to a Canon
		50D DSLR. Some of my photographs are available in my 
		<a href="http://gallery.amrutlar.com">Gallery</a>.
