_GTK+ Manga Viewer_ is a project that hopes to create a nice [GTK+](http://www.gtk.org/)
interface to look up and view various information on Mangas.

This is an old and strange project because it has been the source of multiple rewrites.  I did
this project in Perl then rewrote it, then rewrote it a third time into Ruby.  These days I'm
using this project as a good way for me to learn more about [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/) and
the [Sequel](http://sequel.rubyforge.org/) ORM.

I predict that this project will never be done!
