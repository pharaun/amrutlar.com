This post will document my adventure in getting Japanese support to work with
LaTeX.

To begin, make sure you are using the latest version of LaTeX, at this time it
would be TeXLive-2007/2008. I had to remove the old tetex installation which is
explained in the [TeXLive Migration
Guide](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/tex/texlive-migration-guide.xml) on the
Gentoo project site. Just make sure that the `cjk` `USE` flag is enabled and that
you have also added `ja_JP ja` to your `LINGUAS` var in `/etc/make.conf` which will
then compile the TeXLive system with CJK and Japanese support included. Beware
its a very large set of packages so it may take a while to download on a slow
connection.

##Install Cyberbit for X11

These steps are optional.

Download the Cyberbit font from
[Cyberbit.ZIP](http://http.netscape.com.edgesuite.net/pub/communicator/extras/fonts/windows/Cyberbit.ZIP)
then unzip it to `/tmp/` directory.

Execute the following commands:

    sudo mkdir /usr/share/fonts/ttf-cyberbit
    sudo chown root:root /usr/share/fonts/ttf-cyberbit
    sudo cp /tmp/Cyberbit.ttf /usr/share/fonts/ttf-cyberbit/cyberbit.ttf
    sudo mkfontdir /usr/share/fonts/ttf-cyberbit
{:.text}

Update the `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` to include the new font directory.

Restart the X11 server.

Finally update the font cache via `sudo fc-cache -vf` command.

##Prepare Cyberbit for installation

Create a temponary folder in `/tmp/` directory and copy the `cyberbit.ttf` font
from the previous step into that folder and rename it to `cyberb.ttf`.

Copy the `subfonts.pe` file, which can be found in the
`/usr/share/textmf/scripts/subfonts/` directory, to the temponary directory
that was made in the previous step.

Download the
[`Unicode.sfd`](http://lists.ffii.org/pipermail/cjk/2006-February/001355.html)
file from the post in which the author has extended the file's Unicode listing
to support more characters. Rename the `.obj` extension of the file to `.bz2`
then bunzip the file to the temponary directory made earlier.

To generate all of the needed files for LaTeX fontforge must be installed.
To install it execute `emerge media-gfx/fontforge`.

Once fontforge has been installed execute this command to generate all of
the needed files, however be aware that depending on the computer's speed it
could take several hours!

    fontforge -script subfont.pe cyberb.ttf cyberb Unicode.sfd
{:.text}

Once all of the needed files has been generated by fontforge, create the
`cyberb.map` file by executing these command:

    for i in *.pfb
    do
    echo "$(basename $i .pfb) $(basename $i .pfb) <$i" >> cyberb.map
    done
{:.bash}

This step involves the creation of several directories, so here's the list
of directories to generate:

    mkdir -p ~/texmf/fonts/{afm, tfm, type1}/cyberb
    mkdir -p ~/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/cyberb
{:.text}

Now copy all of the files generated by fontforge into the proper directory:

    cd
    cp *.afm ~/texmf/fonts/afm/cyberb/
    cp *.tfm ~/texmf/fonts/tfm/cyberb/
    cp *.pfb ~/texmf/fonts/type1/cyberb/
    cp cyberb.map ~/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/cyberb/
{:.text}

Create a `ls-R` database in the `~/texmf/` directory so that LaTeX can find all
the files that it needs to by executing `texhash`

Finally update the maps by executing `updmap --edit` which will open the
mapfile in your `$EDITOR` which in my case is vim. Once the mapfile is opened in
the `$EDITOR` add at the bottom of the file "`Map cyberb.map`" without the
quotation then save the file and the command should automatically
generate/update the mapping database.

Create a testing CJK LaTeX file to ensure that everything has been setup
and installed properly, here's an example:

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{CJKutf8}
    \begin{document}
    \begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{song}
    オバマわたし
    \end{CJK*} (this is a test)
    \end{document}
{:.latex}

Execute `pdflatex` on the test LaTeX file to generate a pdf, then open the pdf to
see if the CJK characters were generated properly and are rendering properly in
the pdf file. There should be no error on the output.


##Optional

If the `~/texmf/` in the home directory is bothersome, or if its desired to have
CJK-LaTeX support for all of the users on the system, then the only part that
has to be changed is to replace the `~` with `/usr/share/texmf-site/` which is the
site-specific directory for all of the extra TeXLive files that are specific to
this computer. And also will need to execute the `texhash` and replace the `updmap
--edit` command with `updmap-sys --edit` and run both command as root.


##Update

There has been some new information on how to do it properly in the Gentoo way,
and it is instead executing `texhash`, and running `updmap --edit`, or
`updmap-sys --edit`. It is better to instead create a new file named
`texlive-custom.cfg` in the `/etc/texmf/updmap.d/` directory and put "`Map
cyberb.map`" in that said file then run `texmf-update` which will take care
of generating all of the `ls-R` files, and updating the font map.

However one issue is that for the site wide settings to work it will be needed
to wipe the `.texmf-config/` and `.texmf-var/` directory out of the user's home
directory to make LaTeX pick up on the new system-wide settings.
