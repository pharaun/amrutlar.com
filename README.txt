Fix up the general filter/scripts for sass & nanoc3

implement some sort of html tidy to clean up my html so its nice and pretty

implement something like section/paragraph headings links to each for like
resume/about page, etc...

disable rounded corners for anything below ie9, and set the conditional to be
less than or equal to ie9

1) fix the rounded corner on footer, its way too much (content is good)
2) darkern the content to be same darkness as the footer
3) verify the grey on the header == grey on the footer
4) making the bottom line on the header a bit lighter (dark grey) so it merges
smoothly
5) consider removing the background on the footer so its 100% transparent

6) need more content in the summary because the content box looks a bit on the
small side, 2-3 paragraph? also consider have some sort of marker like \n\n\n
to "enclosure/finish off" the summary so i don't need to provide a seperate
one.

7) Need to fix this with some jQuery magic latter - table alignment

8) fix the date/time box to use em not pixels
9) fix the headers (h4) spacing
